# Test the integration between frontend and backend

The Todo application is now fully operational with:

## ✅ Backend (http://localhost:8000)
- Authentication system working (signup, login, logout)
- Task management system working (create, read, update, delete tasks)
- Database connection established with PostgreSQL
- All API endpoints accessible and functional

## ✅ Frontend (http://localhost:3000)
- Successfully connects to backend API
- Properly handles authentication flows
- Can create, view, update, and delete tasks
- Responsive UI with proper error handling

## ✅ Integration Points Verified:
- Frontend can register new users via backend API
- Frontend can authenticate users and receive JWT tokens
- Frontend can manage tasks using authenticated API calls
- Database persists user accounts and tasks correctly
- Cross-origin requests work properly between frontend and backend

## 🚀 Ready for Use:
The application is fully configured and operational. Users can visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Todo application with complete authentication and task management functionality.
